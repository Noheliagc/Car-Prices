# What Drives The Price of a Car? 
 

This project investigate factors influencing used car prices to provide recommendations for a used car dealership. By analyzing a dataset of 426,000 used cars from Kaggle, the analysis explores which car attributes impact price the most, helping the dealership refine its inventory and pricing strategies.
The data has very specific features, allowing for an extensive exploration of factors that may affect pricing. I took the time to analyze almost all of them to gain a broader and deeper understanding, as car purchasing decisions can vary across many aspects.

## Business Objective

The goal of this analysis is to determine which factors most significantly affect the price of a used car, enabling the client a used car dealership to optimize inventory and pricing strategies based on consumer preferences and valuation.

## Data Overview
- The dataset includes features such as 
  - **Price**
  - **Condition**.
  - **Manufacturer**
  - **Drive Type**
  - **Transmission**
  - **Cylinders**
  - **Odometer**: Mileage of the car.
  - **Fuel Type**
  - **Model**
  - And other attributes such as paint color, car age, and state.


## Findings and Recommendations

- Cars with lower mileage generally have higher prices, reinforcing the value of sourcing cars with less wear and tear.
- Luxury brands command higher prices, itâ€™s beneficial to highlight these brands as premium offerings in the inventory. 
- Economy and mid-range brands have more moderate price ranges.
- New and Like New cars tend to have higher median prices, as expected, indicating that consumers value newer and pristine-condition vehicles.
- Good and Excellent conditions also show decent price ranges, but with slightly lower medians than new cars. 
- Fair and Salvage conditions have significantly lower prices, as they typically represent cars with noticeable wear or damag.
- Electric cars tend to have a higher price compared to other fuel types.
- Hybrid cars have the lowest median price, which might reflect their age, availability, or consumer demand in the used market.
- 4WD Generally associated with higher prices, which may be due to its association with more rugged and durable vehicles.
- RWD Tends to have a moderate price range, often seen in performance vehicles.
- FWD Generally has lower prices, likely due to its common use in more economical vehicles.
- Higher Cylinder vehicles, such as those with 8, 10, and 12 cylinders, tend to have higher prices.
- 4-Cylinder Cars tend to have a much lower price range compared to those with higher. This aligns with the fact that 4-cylinder engines are generally found in more economical and compact cars.
  
Some intersting findings are also that States like Wyoming, Alaska, and Montana have higher average used car prices, while states such as Maine and Vermont have lower average prices.
  
 
### Recommendations:

- Emphasizing high-performance in luxury cars can attract customers seeking high-end vehicles and potentially increase profit margins.
- Positioning Mid-range brands as reliable and affordable options can appeal to a wider customer base. Offering financing or promotional deals on these brands may also drive sales in this segment.
- Highlight New and Like new cars as premium options, as they attract higher prices and appeal to buyers seeking pristine condition.
- Good and excellent cars as reliable, affordable choices for buyers looking for quality without paying for a brand-new car.
- Present "Fair" and salvage" cars as budget options, clearly communicating any wear to attract cost-conscious buyers.
- Electric vehicles command higher median prices, so emphasize their long-term savings and environmental benefits to justify the premium.
- Position Gas and other fuel types as reliable, budget-friendly choices for traditional buyers, focusing on affordability and availability.
- Promote hybrids as cost-effective and eco-friendly options, especially for buyers looking for fuel efficiency without the higher price tag of electric vehicles.
- 4WD options are ideal for rugged, off-road needs, while RWD suits performance-oriented buyers, and FWD offers a more economical choice for daily use.
- For clients prioritizing economy, 4-cylinder vehicles are more affordable and practical for everyday use. Additionally, categories like "3 cylinders" and "other" offer budget-friendly options with diverse types, appealing to those open to varied models within a modest budget.
